This module customizes the datetime picker widget and allows to define a default 
time to be applied in case the user selects only a Date.

For example, if a user wants to define a commitment date without having to specify
the time on that date, setting the default time value on the field in the Form view
allows to ensure the commitment date will be set to this time instead of the time
when the page was loaded by the browser.
