This module extends the functionality of timesheets to support linking
them to preexisting invoices and to allow you to anticipate invoicing,
even before the work hours are actually done.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because some people need to sell project hours
in advance, before they have been actually executed, but still want to
have normal traceability.

Odoo normally just links timesheet lines to invoices when they were
linked to a sale order line and, afterwards, that line is invoiced. But
if the invoice was done in advance, there's no linking between the
timesheet and the invoice, and there's no way to link them, not even
manually and not even when the invoice was already done in the past.

Configuration
=============

To be able to use this module, you need these permissions:

-  *Timesheets / Administrator*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Timesheets / Timesheets / All Timesheets*.
2. Select the list view.
3. Click on the icon in the top-right corner and display the column
   *Invoice*.
4. Link the timesheet lines with the invoices you want from the same
   customer.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Add a wizard that helps mass-linking done timesheets with their
   invoices.
