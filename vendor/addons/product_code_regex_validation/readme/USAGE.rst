On each Product Category you can set the desired regular expression. The validation will
be done when:
- Creating a new product.
- Modifying the default code of a product.
- Modifying the Product Category of a product.
- Unarchiving a product.

Moreover, the regular expression on the Product Category will only be able to be changed
if all products in the category have a valid code format.
