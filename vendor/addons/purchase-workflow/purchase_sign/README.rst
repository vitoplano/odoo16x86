This module allows to take online signatures from vendors to confirm purchase orders.It adds a global configuration (Online signature) which can be accessed through Purchase->Configuration->Settings and it can further be handled also on each of the purchase orders.When it is enabled, it shows a button 'Accept & Sign' on the portal to the vendors for RFQ which are sent by email to them.Once the vendor accepts and adds their signature, the RFQ gets confirmed into a purchase order
