Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to Settings / Technical / Database Structure / Fields Tooltips and
  configure tooltips for a field for a model. You will then be able to see
  on the form view of the model you chose, next to the label of the field you
  selected, the tooltip appear.

* You can also go directly on the form view of a model on which you want to
  add a tooltip and use the Manage tooltips Action to add a new tooltip, or edit
  or delete existing tooltips for this model.

* For manager users, they can decide to display an helper to add a tooltip
  on a field as some fields are not displayed with a label.
